### Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis

Recently, I conducted an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to deeply examine customer data. This method allows for segmenting customers based on three main criteria, enabling the development of more effective marketing strategies.

1. **Recency**: The date of the customerâ€™s most recent purchase.
2. **Frequency**: The number of purchases made within a specific time period.
3. **Monetary**: The total amount spent by the customer.

Through this analysis, I gained insights into customer shopping behaviors, allowing me to create targeted campaigns. The insights obtained helped to increase customer loyalty and boosted sales by 25%.
